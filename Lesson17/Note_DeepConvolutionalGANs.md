# Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

very sensitive to hyperparameters

## Upsampling and deconvolution

transpose convolution:  from narrow and deep to wide and flat (move one pixel in input layer --> move two pixels in output layer)

## Batch Normalization

- Batch_Normalization_Lesson.ipynb - A notebook showing you how batch normalization works
- Batch_Normalization_Exercises.ipynb - Exercises for you to implement batch normalization
- Batch_Normalization_Solutions.ipynb - Solutions to those exercises

## DCGAN implementation

-  dcgan-svhn

## DCGAM and generator

Generator and Discriminator are Convolution network

## Semi-supervised learning

discriminator: real1, real2, .... real_n, fake -- n + 1 discrimination

### feature matching
